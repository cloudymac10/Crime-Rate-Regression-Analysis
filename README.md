# Crime-Rate-Regression-Analysis
This project explores the relationships between socioeconomic factors and crime rates using a dataset of 14 predictors and one response variable (crime rate, R). The goal was to construct a regression model that satisfies the assumptions of linear regression and provides actionable insights into the cause of crime rates.
